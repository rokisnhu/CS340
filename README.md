How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I make it as easy to understand and as adaptable as I can. For the Python CRUD module, the advantages of this were that the module was easily extensible for the modules we used it in in the future. I could use this module in the future to interface with any other instance of MongoDB I may end up using.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
For the project that worked with Grazioso Salvare, I did my best to understand his requirements and stamp out exactly what he was wanting and what I would need to do to implement those changes. This differs from other courses because I would not have usually been this precise or exact. 


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
To engineer and develop computer-based solutions to optimize or streamline processes in order to maximize efficiencies in our work. This matters because the work of computer scientists drive productivity and allow us to process data in a way not previously possible by leveraging the power of computers.
